# LA Basin model
 
This is a 3D model of the Los Angeles Basin, California. It was constructed by Lauren Schultz for her Masters dissertation with an aim to assess the impacts of the basin’s complex geologic history on the thermal history of the basin, complicated by the basin’s exposure to a number of often conflicting thermal effects, which overlap through geologic time. It examines the thermal effects of successive tectonic episodes, including: a) pre-basinal subduction of the Farallon plate through the Paleogene resulting in early depression of isotherms; b) subsequent subduction of the East Pacific Ridge and transition to a transform plate boundary, associated with volcanism, crustal extension and increased heat flow; and c) rapid subsidence of the basin initiated in the middle to late Miocene, producing in turn a cooling effect through the thermal blanketing effects of deposited sediments and the lateral heat loss through steep basin margins. Present day subsurface temperatures and maturity markers of the Nodular Shale source rock require a rapid ramping up of heat flow from the cooler tectonic phase of subduction into high Miocene heat flow values up to 100 mW/m2 near the basin center in order to match modern basin conditions. This increased heat flow phase which peaked at about 15 Ma contributed to the successful development of the Los Angeles Basin’s relatively young petroleum systems by allowing for the recent maturation of kerogen over the last 3 m.y. in the basin’s middle to late Miocene source rock, ultimately producing at least 10 BBOE in accumulated reserves (Beyer, 1995).

Present-day temperature and vitrinite with depth plots used for thermal calibration of the model. These plots represent a sub-selection of the 17 total locations used for thermal calibration. All plots present modeled results using the final heat flow scenario. Model results for temperature (blue line) and vitrinite reflectance (black line) show strong match with calibration data (black cross)
